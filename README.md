# Group-Project-1

#An app for locating a brewery or bar in a user-selected city.

API's Used:  OpenBrewery, Google Maps

Created with:  HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Firebase, Bootstrap

# HTML & CSS - Bill Coury
Biggest accomplishment was getting the bubbles to work over the background image.  Tried to make a very basic looking page with large containers to make it easy for viewing on multiple devices.

# Google Maps Platform - Jeff Corpuz
Working through the google maps platform was tough. Initially, I thought I would only use one of their services for the project. I ended up using one key tied to 14 different services to make sure I had everything covered.  Also, I now have a greater apperication for documnetation.  I felt that I have read more documentation than writing code. For example, to avoid charges to the api key, I had to use their Places Search service with Autocomplete.  Autocomplete restricted the search to just cities within the US and further restriceted the search to only the viewport of the map.  

# API keys, small parts of JS and Ppt - Neha Nehru
The most difficult part was to get the right API keys, make sure they are working. This meant making sure they are open to front end users. Most of the time I had to look for this particular type of documentation, it wasn't readily available. Also some dbs can only be opened in a particular platform and hence by adding a 'https://cors-escape.herokuapp.com/' to the front of our link could force it to work as well. Solving some of the JS issues in colaboration with Jacob was also another challenge. Being stuck on a piece of code that in theory should work but isn't. Learnt troubleshooting in a more effective manner.
