# Google Maps Platform - Jeff Corpuz
Working through the google maps platform was tough. Initially, I thought I would only one of their services for the project. I ended up using one key tied to 14 different services to make sure I had everything covered.  Also, I now have a greater apperication for documnetation.  I felt that I have read more documentation than writing code. For example, to avoid charges to the api key, I had to use their Places Search service with Autocomplete.  Autocomplete restricted the search to just cities within the US and further restriceted the search to only the viewport of the map.
